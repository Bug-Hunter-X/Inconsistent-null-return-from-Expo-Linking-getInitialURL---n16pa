This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Linking.getInitialURL()` API where it sometimes returns null unexpectedly, even when a deep link is used to open the application. This inconsistency makes it difficult to reliably handle deep links, leading to application malfunctions. The `bug.js` file shows the problem and its inconsistent behavior; the `bugSolution.js` shows a possible workaround involving retries and state management.  This repo aims to highlight the issue and encourage a fix within the Expo SDK.
